          On my days off you're likely to find me paddle boarding, reading a
          good book or trying new foods. I am forever expanding my knowledge and
          understanding of the world and the people in it. I am also most
          passionate about knitting - a craft that requires patience
          and precision - much like programming.
          <br></br>
          <br></br>
          Iâ€™m currently working as a barista and this has not only allowed me to
          make a mean cappuccino but has also taught me invaluable lessons about
          teamwork, customer service, and the art of managing high-pressure
          situations with grace and integrity.
          <br></br>
          <br></br>
          In the long term, I envision myself transitioning into a Project
          Management role. I am excited by the prospect of leading diverse
          teams, managing resources, and delivering projects that exceed client
          expectations.
          <br></br>
          <br></br>
          As you can see, I am a blend of creativity, technical prowess, and
          social skills. I am a firm believer in balancing work and play, and I
          strive to bring a sense of joy and enthusiasm to everything I do. I
          look forward to bringing my unique blend of skills and passions to a
          team where I can learn, grow, and contribute positively.
